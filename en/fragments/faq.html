        <h3>What are the benefits of a local warranty?</h3>
        <p>
          <strong>Simplicity & speed.</strong> Support is handled on-site: no international shipping, reduced delays, and often resolution in days rather than weeks.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>No hidden costs.</strong> No overseas shipping fees, package insurance, or unexpected customs charges on return; your budget is fully controlled from start to finish.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Smooth communication.</strong> A local contact who speaks your language and shares your time zone makes diagnosis, follow-up, and understanding the warranty much easier.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Quality & reliability of service.</strong> Repairs are done directly at our factory, with parts available and on-site testing, minimizing back-and-forth and unpleasant surprises.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Resale value.</strong> A local warranty builds trust and is more easily recognized or transferred, helping you resell the product more effectively.
